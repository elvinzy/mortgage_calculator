# mortgage_calculator
This is a project to create mortgage calculator

There are three parameters to be input:
1. Loan amount ($)
2. Loan period (years)
3. Annual interest rate (%)

Once the parameters are input, the mortgage calculator will calculate the monthly repayment amount as well as plotting the owing amount against time.
